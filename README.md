# Multi-class classification model

The aim of this project is to classify *E. coli* proteins using the amino acid sequences in their cell localization sites. This can be used to predict how a protein will bind to a cell based on its chemical composition before it is folded.

### Data description

File name: [ecoli.csv](https://github.com/agolikova/Multi-class-classification-model/blob/main/ecoli.csv). This dataset was adapted from Kenta Nakai and Paul Horton's, used in their 1996 paper titled [“A Probabilistic Classification System For Predicting The Cellular Localization Sites Of Proteins”](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8877510/).

The proteins belong to one of 5 classes:

* cp: cytoplasm
* im: inner membrane without signal sequence
* pp: periplasm
* imU: inner membrane, non cleavable signal sequence
* om: outer membrane
